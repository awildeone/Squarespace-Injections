#Front Page Video Background
-----------------
Part of this script was originally posted on stackexchange, but I now can not find the original author (and I'm lazy), but applaud the person who created it. The other half was created by my friend Ubercow, who is an actual programmer (He made the mute button).

##What it looks like
This is the site it't currently used on as of right now. [Foursquare Camps](http://foursquarecamps.com)

##Setup Steps

For this to work you have to upload the video to Squarespace so that it loads off of their servers. If there is a video on youtube, I recommend using [Keepvid](http://keepvid.com) if you like using a GUI or [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) if you want to make sure you get the best possible video. I also recommend not using a high bitrate or resolution, Because really, the most commonly viewed websites are from mobile devices, so who cares if its 4K or not.

1. Upload the file to squarespace. You will need to have a page that allows you to upload a file. [Squarespace | Upload Files](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205813928-Uploading-and-managing-files)
2. Once the file is uploaded, right click the hyperlinked text and select "copy link to clipboard" (Should be "some-coolish-site.squarespace.com/mycoolishmovie.mp4" or something like that). Paste into notes or something. You'll need this soon.
3. Once you have the link, copy the code from [Front Page Video Background.js](https://github.com/awildeone/Squarespace-Injections/blob/master/Front%20Page%20Video/Front%20Page%20Video%20Background.js) to clipboard.
4. Click the gear icon next to *Home*
5. Click *Advanced* and paste the code into the code injection.
6. Scroll through and find the part that says 'INSERT-VIDEO-URL-HERE', and replace that with your video link from earlier.
..* *Protip*: Make sure the URL is in quotes
7. Profit

I will be putting all negative comments in the garbage since I don't consider myself a programmer :) lol

If you have any improvements, or a better way of doing this, let me know!
