#Squarespace Injections

Squarespace is great. But now having used it for a while, I almost always find a template is never quite what I want. Thats where the stuff here comes in.

I have begun scouring the internet for stackexchange pages and reddit posts that help create the look for the site that I want. Credit for the code will be given where it's due (if I remember lol) but I will also do my best to learn along the way so I can eventually just write my own (SoonTM).

All negative comments will be put in the trash, cause thats where they belong :) (The code is bad, yes I know).

Always open for outside help!
